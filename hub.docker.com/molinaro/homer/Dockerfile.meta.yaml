      Value: '"HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) is a suite
        of tools for Motif Discovery and next-gen sequencing analysis.  It is a collection
        of command line programs for unix-style operating systems written in Perl
        and C++. HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm
        and is well suited for finding 8-20 bp motifs in large scale genomics data.  HOMER
        contains many useful tools for analyzing ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq,
        Hi-C and numerous other types of functional genomics sequencing data sets"'
