# Dockerfile for building a cross developing environment for Qt
# targeting Windows. It also builds the application in the current
# directory. The application will be statically linked against
# Qt.
#
# To build the environment invoke
#  docker build -t qt .
# in the directory of this file. This creates a docker image
# called "qt". Note that it will take a while if you are building
# this image the first time. The contained application will also
# be compiled (in principle the last step could be done within
# the running container).
#
# Once build, you can enter the container via
#  docker run qt -ti bash

# Note that Docker requires a relatively recent Linux kernel.
# 3.8 is the current minimum.
